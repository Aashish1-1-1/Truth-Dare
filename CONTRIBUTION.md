# To Contribute

### If you have any crazy creative idea
Please open an issue in the main repo.

### Fork and Pull Request Flow ðŸªœ

1. Head over to the [Truth-Dare GitHub repo](https://github.com/Aashish1-1-1/Truth-Dare) and "fork it" into your own GitHub account.
2. Clone your fork to your local machine, using the following command:

```shell
# replace USERNAME with your GitHub username
git clone git@github.com:USERNAME/Truth-Dare.git
```

3. Please use a feature branch based on **\`main\`** for your changes. This allows easier synchronization with the main repository:

```shell
git switch main
git switch -c your-awesome-new-feature
```

4. Implement the changes or additions you intend to contribute. Whether it's **bug fixes**, **new features**, or **enhancements**, this is where you put your coding skills to use.

5. Once your changes are ready, you may then commit and push the changes from your working branch:

```shell
git commit -m "fix: nice commit description"
git push origin your-awesome-new-feature
```

6. Create a Pull Request to main repo.
